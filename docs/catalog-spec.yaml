# Catalog Specification Guidelines

# Define the API version for the catalog
apiVersion: v1

# List of schemas to be included in the catalog
schemas:
  # Each schema entry should define a unique domain, typically hyphenated
  # The format is <input-type>.<use-case> or <industry>.<use-case> for industry-specific schemas
  - domain: # Specify the domain name, e.g., document.utility-bill

    # Define the schema path using the format: vlmrun.hub.schemas.<category>.<name>.<ClassName>
    # Note that this is the fully qualified path to the schema class, and contains underscores instead of hyphens
    schema: # e.g., vlmrun.hub.schemas.document.utility_bill.UtilityBill

    # Provide a prompt that describes the full prompt to use for the call into the VLM.
    prompt: # e.g., "You are a detail-oriented invoice analyst..."

    # Give a brief description or motivation for the schema
    description: # e.g., "Comprehensive invoice data extraction system..."

    # Provide a publicly accessible URL to sample data for testing and reference
    sample_data: # e.g., "https://storage.googleapis.com/vlm-data-public-prod/hub/examples/document.invoice-extraction/invoice_1.jpg"

    # Metadata section for additional information
    metadata:
      # List the types of inputs supported by the schema
      # Currently, only `image`, `video`, and `document` are supported.
      supported_inputs: # e.g., ["image", "document"]

      # Add relevant tags for categorization and searchability in the catalog
      tags: # e.g., ["document", "finance"]

# Note: Ensure each schema entry is complete and follows the structure above.
# Use consistent naming conventions and provide meaningful descriptions.
